# Classification of different models of cars
Explored different datasets and class labels found in https://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html.

## Motivation
Our goal for this project was to create a model to predict the make, model, and year of different cars.  The dataset we used had 196 different classes and it was split into 8,144 training images and 8,041 testing images.
