# Vehicle Re-Identification

There are many ways to improve the transportation and traffic systems. Vehicle Re-Identification helps traffic engineers understand journey times along entire corridors.Re-identification is the problem of matching appearances of objects across different cameras. With the proliferation of surveillance cameras enabling smart and safer cities, there is an ever-increasing need to re-identify vehicles across cameras.We started by treating this as a classification problem where any car image will be classified as one of the 333 classes present in the data. We tried 2 pre-trained models. One was ResNet50 model trained on ImageNet dataset as pretrained model for image classifier. The other was ResNet50 model trained on stanford cars dataset. The second pre-trained model gave better classification results.  

Since AICity Challenge for Vehicle Re-Identification needs top 100 results from test data for every query image, in order to get these top 100 matches, we use the penultimate layer (Linear layer of size 512) to extract features of size 512 for each test and query image. We then tried both KNN and ANNOY to get us the top 100 matches. In the few trials we ran, ANNOY gave slightly better results. We tried a subset of AICity challenge dataset on Platform.ai - with 10 classes and 50 images for each class. We labled few images on platform and trained the model. We achieved an accuracy of 91%.
