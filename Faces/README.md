# Face detection using Platform.ai and ArcFace implementation in Pytorch & Fast.ai

[Addictive Angular Loss Margin (ArcFace) paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07698)

The aim of the project is to build a face classification model based on the VGGFace2 dataset and the CelebA dataset with the ArcFace loss function. According to the paper, ArcFace archives state-of-the-art accuracy with multiple large facial recognition datasets. ArcFace provides improvement over other loss functions (SphereFace, Intraloss, Triplet Loss) by penalising the marginal distance between the sample and the centre of the class on hypersphere.
